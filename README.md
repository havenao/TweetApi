# TOPICAL TWEETS API

## Using the API
This simple Tweet Api lets you access tweets of a given topic.
Current supported topics are: #healthcare, #nasa, #opensource

Use the GET "/tweets/{topic}" endpoint to return JSON with the lastest 10 tweets on that topic (do not include the "#").
ex: "https://{root}/tweets/nasa" 

We pull the most recent tweets every hour.
